functions in javascript

in javascript a function is a block of reusable code that performs the specific task.
Functions allow us to encapsulate the logic, making our code modular, and we can 
easily maintain the code and it will more readable.

There are different way to define the functions in javascript

1) Function Declaration 

A function can be declared using the "function" keyword.

//function functionName


2) Function expression:

A function can also be defined as an expression. in this case, the function is assgined to variable.

3) Arrow Functions
Arrow functions provide a more concise way to write the functions. 

4) IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression)

An IIFE is a function that is exectued Immediately after it is defined.

5) anonymous function : // a fuction without the function name is nothing anonoymous function 

6) Parametes and arguments
Functions can accept Parametes. if we wanted to add the default pareamter value

7) HOF
higher order functions
A higher function is a function that acceps another function as an argument.
