"for loop "in javascript allows us to execute the block of code repeatdly for the specified number of iterations.

//syntax
for(initializtion; condition; increment/decrement){
    //block of code
}


initializtion: this is executed once before the loop starts. 

condition: this expression is evaluted before each iteration.  if it is true the body will be executed 
if false it will come out of the loop

increment/decrement: this expression is executed after each iteration of the loop

// 1) i = 0; 0 < 5 ----o/p: 0
         
            1
//2) i = 1; 1 < 5 ...o/p..: 1

            2
//3) i = 2; 2 < 5...0/p; 2

           3

//4) i = 3; 3< 5 ...o/p: 3
         4

//5) i =4 ; 4< 5....0/P 4

        5
//6) i = 5; 5<5
